# Leetcode Problem 1: Two Sum
'''
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j. 
You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition. 
Return the answer with the smaller index first.
