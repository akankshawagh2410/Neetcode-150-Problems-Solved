# Leetcode Problem 36: Valid Sudoku
'''
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
- Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
- Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
- Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:
- Return true if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return false
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

# Code Solution: 

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        boxes = [set() for _ in range(9)]

        for r in range(9):
            for c in range(9):
                val = board[r][c]
                if val == '.':
                    continue

                box_id = (r // 3) * 3 + (c // 3)

                if val in rows[r] or val in cols[c] or val in boxes[box_id]:
                    return False

                rows[r].add(val)
                cols[c].add(val)
                boxes[box_id].add(val)

        return True
